# Solution Steps

1. Design the normalized PostgreSQL schema: define tables for authors, books, categories, users, the many-to-many book_categories join, and logs for activity.

2. Add appropriate foreign keys (with ON DELETE behavior), unique constraints, table indexes, and full text indexes for efficient search.

3. Write schema DDL in db/schema.sql for atomic table creation.

4. Create the async database interface: use asyncpg to manage a connection pool, and expose DB functions as async methods in db/db.py.

5. Implement async CRUD operations for authors, books (including many-to-many category relations via book_categories), categories, and users, ensuring each is non-blocking and uses transactions where needed.

6. For book listing/search, use full-text search for title/description and efficient join strategies; index everything so queries scale well.

7. Implement a log_action async method that inserts user search/log activity into the logs table.

8. In main.py, use the provided API endpoint scaffolding, but wire up the endpoints to call the async DB methods implemented in db/db.py.

9. For /books/ search/list endpoint, hook up a FastAPI background task to perform async logging (db.log_action) of search requests.

10. On FastAPI startup/shutdown, create and close the asyncpg pool.

11. Ensure that lookups and search endpoints use indexed queries and do not perform N+1 queries for categories (fetch all categories for batch of books efficiently).

12. Validate that all DB operations are fully async-compatible and tested for concurrency.
